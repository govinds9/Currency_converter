# Currency Converter 
Project Title: Currency Converter

Project Description:
--------------------
The React Currency Converter is a web application that allows users to quickly and easily convert between different currencies. This project leverages React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create an interactive and user-friendly currency conversion tool.

Features:
---------
1. **Currency Conversion:** Users can enter an amount in one currency and select another currency to convert to. The application fetches the latest exchange rates from a currency API to provide accurate conversion results.

2. **Real-time Data:** The application uses the `UseCurrencyInfo` custom hook to fetch the latest exchange rate data from the currency API for the selected currencies. This ensures that users always get up-to-date conversion rates.

3. **Swap Currencies:** Users can easily swap the "From" and "To" currencies with the click of a "Swap" button, making it convenient to switch the conversion direction.

4. **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience on different screen sizes and devices.

How to Use:
-----------
1. Enter the amount you want to convert in the "From" section.
2. Select the currency you want to convert from the dropdown list in the "From" section.
3. The "To" section displays the converted amount in the selected currency.
4. Use the "Swap" button to reverse the conversion direction.
5. Click the "Convert" button to perform the currency conversion.

This project serves as a practical example of building a currency converter using React and demonstrates how to fetch real-time data from an external API using a custom hook. It provides a foundation for anyone looking to create a similar tool or learn about React state management and API integration.
